TODO:
- Add feature to automatically detect the attribute acceptance data type
  (for example: ThunderAbility require location, which supported data type are Entity (got from .location) and Location for now)

- Add feature to automatically know which attribute is configurable by the user

- Add feature to set available skill's trigger target type (of course with the list of available trigger types)

The Create Skill Flow:
1. User set human readable identifier
2. Select skill trigger. Allow it to create multiple branch, but per branch only have one trigger.
   (Branch: Pair of trigger and sets of abilities, so the skill can have multiple variation)
3.1. Add ability to the skill (ThunderAbility, IgniteAbility, etc)
3.2. Set the target based on allowed type of trigger.
3.3. Configure the attributes

Example case: ThunderSpeed Skill. Strike thunder to the trigger target #1 and apply speed potion effect buff to the trigger target #2
Trigger (just one for simplicity example):
- On Attack

Abilities:
- Thunder (target_type: defender [got from the trigger execution data]) {} // no configurable settings, so empty json
- PotionEffect (target_type: attacker [got from the trigger execution data]) {"type": "SPEED", "amplifier": 1, "duration": 600}

Translate to plain language:
Strike thunder to the defender and also apply speed potion buff to the attacker
